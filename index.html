        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> My name is  Souleymane Bah, I am a Computer Science student at LIU Brooklyn with a strong interest in backend development. 
            I have experience with Python, C++, and SQL, and while I'm still honing my skills, I’m confident in my ability to solve problems and build effective solutions using these languages. My academic projects have provided hands on experience in data structures, algorithms, and backend design principles. 
            I am eager to apply this knowledge in a professional internship. 
            I’m committed to learning and growing as a human, a software engineer, and I’m excited to contribute to a development team.</p>
